# SuiteSparse-AMD

This package is the port of the SuiteSparse AMD (Approximate Minimum Degree) function. This is a Python C wrapper of the library from [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse).

This package currently only works with Numpy arrays.

## Future

- Work with PyTorch CPU Tensors
- 2D Python iterables
